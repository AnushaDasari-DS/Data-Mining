# Data-Mining
**Abstract:**
Data mining is a process of analysing and understanding the data through cleaning raw data, identifying useful patterns, creating models, testing the models, and predicting the outcomes. In this project various data mining techniques were used to analyse the data and have followed different approaches to increase the accuracy of predictions performed by the models. I have performed some analysis to check what set of features have high effect on accuracy score and have also done visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data. By working on this project, I have learned how to use pipelines for my model and use multi-classifier models. Overall, I have improved on my data mining skills and hope I could find more deep information on the data by continuing my work on this project.


**Problem Statement:**
The main objective of this project is do EDA and build model that could predict the outcomes without overfiiting or underfitting.
Proposed Methodology: Firstly, I intend to start with exploring and analysing the data and then build model that could accurately predict the outcomes. Finally, I intend to deploy the model using ONNX.

This is a brief overview of my project. Please refer file 'Data Mining - Final Project - Anusha Dasari.ipynb' for detailed documentation.
